          # This prompt tells Claude what to do when working on an issue
          prompt: |
            When asked to work on an issue, please:
            1. Create a new branch from the default branch, naming it according to the issue (e.g., issue-123-short-description). Use lowercase and hyphens for branch names.
            2. Make the required changes/fixes as described in the issue.
            3. Open a pull request from the new branch to the default branch, referencing the issue in the PR description using "Fixes #<issue-number>".
            4. Add a summary of changes in the PR description.

            Error Handling:
            - If you encounter test failures, fix them before creating the PR.
            - If changes conflict with the target branch, resolve conflicts before pushing.
            - If you cannot complete the task, add a comment to the issue explaining the blocker.
