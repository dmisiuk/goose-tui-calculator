# Audio Feedback

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Button Press Audio Feedback
The calculator SHALL provide auditory feedback when any button is pressed, using distinct sounds for different button categories to enhance the user experience and provide sensory confirmation of input.

#### Scenario: Number button press
- **WHEN** a user presses a number button (0-9)
- **THEN** the system SHALL play a number-specific sound
- **AND** the sound SHALL complete without blocking the calculator operation

#### Scenario: Standard functional button press
- **WHEN** a user presses a standard functional button (+/-, %, ., +, -, x, /)
- **THEN** the system SHALL play a functional-key sound that differs from the number sound
- **AND** the sound SHALL complete without blocking the calculator operation

#### Scenario: Special action button press
- **WHEN** a user presses a special action button (AC, =)
- **THEN** the system SHALL play a special action sound that differs from both number and standard functional sounds
- **AND** the sound SHALL complete without blocking the calculator operation

#### Scenario: Audio playback failure
- **WHEN** audio playback fails due to system limitations or missing audio hardware
- **THEN** the calculator SHALL continue to function normally without audio
- **AND** no error SHALL be displayed to the user
- **AND** calculator operations SHALL not be delayed or blocked

### Requirement: Cross-Platform Audio Support
The audio feedback system SHALL support playback on Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms, using platform-appropriate audio mechanisms.

#### Scenario: macOS audio playback
- **WHEN** the calculator runs on macOS
- **THEN** audio feedback SHALL use platform-appropriate audio APIs or system commands
- **AND** no additional audio dependencies SHALL be required beyond the Go standard library or minimal platform-specific libraries

#### Scenario: Linux audio playback
- **WHEN** the calculator runs on Linux
- **THEN** audio feedback SHALL use platform-appropriate audio APIs or system commands
- **AND** the system SHALL gracefully handle cases where audio systems (PulseAudio, ALSA) are unavailable

#### Scenario: Windows audio playback
- **WHEN** the calculator runs on Windows
- **THEN** audio feedback SHALL use platform-appropriate audio APIs or system commands
- **AND** audio playback SHALL work without requiring administrator privileges

### Requirement: Audio Categorization
The system SHALL categorize buttons into three distinct groups for audio purposes: number buttons, standard functional buttons, and special action buttons, each producing a unique auditory signature.

#### Scenario: Number button identification
- **WHEN** determining which sound to play for a button press
- **THEN** buttons "0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9" SHALL be classified as number buttons
- **AND** SHALL trigger the number sound effect

#### Scenario: Standard functional button identification
- **WHEN** determining which sound to play for a button press
- **THEN** buttons "+/-", "%", ".", "+", "-", "x", "/" SHALL be classified as standard functional buttons
- **AND** SHALL trigger the functional sound effect

#### Scenario: Special action button identification
- **WHEN** determining which sound to play for a button press
- **THEN** buttons "AC", "=" SHALL be classified as special action buttons
- **AND** SHALL trigger the special action sound effect
